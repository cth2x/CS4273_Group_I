# CS4274 Group I

## Project Overview
Our project builds a user-friendly database to manage and track missing persons in Oklahoma. The site will allow public access which will allow it to serve all Oklahomans. It will be able to store various characteristics related to the missing persons such as Photographs, Age, Gender, Race, Tribal Affiliation, Height, Weight, Hair Color, Eye Color, Date of last contact, and jurisdiction reported missing. Alongside these characteristics, it will also store Tribal Affiliation when applicable to allow it to better serve the tribal nations. The site will also contain various search, filtering, and exporting tools to allow researchers in the missing persons field to better access our data. When a missing person is found their information will be deleted from the database to meet the laws pertaining to this jurisdiction. 

## Technologies Used
### MySQL
Since our project heavily relies on a database to display our information the database chosen needs to be able to handle a large amount of data efficiently. It also needs to be able to filter data and sort it. These factors led us to choose an SQL-based database and we decided on MySQL to be a good choice as it is a free option that seemed to offer good scalability. 

### Some JS framework NEED TO DECIDE
When choosing a framework it seemed a majority of our group seemed confident in javascript therefore we decided to go with a javascript-based framework to develop the website to host and display our database. 

### Docker
It seemed that our group consisted of people with different operating systems so we decided to use Docker in deploying our app so that it would run consistently across all our devices. It also allows for ease of scalability as our project grows.
