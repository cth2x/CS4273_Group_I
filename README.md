# CS4274 Group I

## Project Overview
Our project builds a user-friendly database to manage and track missing persons in Oklahoma. The site will allow public access which will allow it to serve all Oklahomans. It will be able to store various characteristics related to the missing persons such as Photographs, Age, Gender, Race, Tribal Affiliation, Height, Weight, Hair Color, Eye Color, Date of last contact, and jurisdiction reported missing. Alongside these characteristics, it will also store Tribal Affiliation when applicable to allow it to better serve the tribal nations. The site will also contain various search, filtering, and exporting tools to allow researchers in the missing persons field to better access our data. When a missing person is found their information will be deleted from the database to meet the laws pertaining to this jurisdiction. 

## Technologies Used
### MySQL
Since our project heavily relies on a database to display our information the database chosen needs to be able to handle a large amount of data efficiently. It also needs to be able to filter data and sort it. These factors led us to choose an SQL-based database and we decided on MySQL to be a good choice as it is a free option that seemed to offer good scalability. 

### Next.js



### Docker
It seemed that our group consisted of people with different operating systems so we decided to use Docker in deploying our app so that it would run consistently across all our devices. It also allows for ease of scalability as our project grows. 

## Setup Instructions ?? NOT SURE WE DONT REALLY HAVE IT A PROGRAM YET
Docker build

Docker run

## Team Contributions

## Progress Plan NOT SURE

### 1. Setup simple frontend page with JS
choose what library we want to import the data table from, or make a table from scratch
use data from CSV to fill the data table 
### 2. Review features needed with the mentor
Show demo of frontend, decide if any feature is missing, and update demo as needed
### 3. Setup backend database based on requirements
### 4. Connect database to frontend, host site on docker
### 5. Check for any bugs, and show the product to the mentor to see if any changes need to be made
